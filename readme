Capstone_Project (Security Issues in IOT)

In this project, I analyzed the security problems that IOT network equipment will face, 
and introduced the use of machine learning and deep learning methods to protect the Internet of things system through practical application cases.
This method supports the instantiation of security data collection and the deployment of complex application of the Internet of things, 
which is the basis of effective application security. An analysis algorithm for identifying threats, vulnerabilities, and related attack patterns. 
A key prerequisite for implementing this approach is to develop scalable infrastructure resources to collect and process security related data sets from IOT systems and devices. 
Thus, a scalable and configurable data collection infrastructure security is introduced for the data-driven Internet of things.


Besides, I introduced the Security MicroVisor (SμV), a formally-verified pure software-based security middleware for high-constrained low-end IoT devices. 
In particular, SμV tackles the problem of lack of hardware memory isolation common to most IETF Class-1 devices. 
SμV isolates a trusted software module from untrusted application and uses it to contribute to pure softwarebased security applications, 
namely remote attestation, secure code update, and secure erasure.
